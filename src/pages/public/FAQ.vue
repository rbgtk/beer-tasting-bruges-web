      <h3 class="font-bold">Where does the tasting take place?</h3>
      <p>We currently offer tastings at two great locations in Bruges, each with its own unique character:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <span class="font-bold">Resto Mojo</span>
          – A warm and creative restaurant just outside the city center. This is a more intimate, sit-down tasting,
          perfect for couples, private groups, or anyone looking for a relaxed evening. This tasting includes a
          charcuterie plate with cheeses, cured meats, and snacks specially paired with the beers.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="font-bold">The Bauhaus</span>
          – A social and lively venue in the old town, ideal for travelers and small groups. The focus here is on
          discovering great beer in a casual setting. Food is not included at this tasting, though you’re welcome to
          grab something from the hostel bar before or after.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="space-y-2">
      <h3 class="font-bold">Can I book a private tasting?</h3>
      <p>
        Yes! Whether it’s a team event, a bachelor(ette) party, or a family get-together, we offer private tastings at
        Resto Mojo or another location that fits your group. Just reach out to chat about options.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="space-y-2">
      <h3 class="font-bold">Is food included?</h3>
      <p>
        Both at Resto Mojo and the Bauhaus, you’ll enjoy a generous charcuterie board with your tasting. However, if
        you're looking to have dinner after the tasting, we do recommend Resto Mojo for its menu options.
      </p>

    <div class="space-y-2">
      <h3 class="font-bold">What if I don’t like beer?</h3>
      <p>
        No problem! You’re not alone. We’ve had many guests who were skeptical at first but ended up surprised by what
        they liked. The tasting is all about exploring and enjoying at your own pace.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="space-y-2">
      <h3 class="font-bold">Are there non-alcoholic options?</h3>

        The tasting is centered around beer, but if you’re not drinking alcohol, we can offer a few non-alcoholic
        alternatives—just let us know when booking.
